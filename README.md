# Tower Defense Game (SDL, C++)

A 2D **Tower Defense** game built using **C++** and the **SDL library**, focused on performance optimization and real-time gameplay.

## Features
- **Interactive gameplay**: Place towers, fight waves of enemies, and manage resources.
- **Collision detection**: Implemented with **Quadtree spatial partitioning** for efficient projectile-enemy interactions.
- **Dynamic pathfinding**: Enemies adjust routes dynamically to navigate obstacles.
- **Tower logic**: Priority queue system allows towers to target enemies by distance, health, or type.

## Why This Project
This project helped me explore:
- Event-driven programming
- Real-time updates in game loops
- Data structures applied to performance-critical systems

## How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OladayoOyedeji/Tower-Defense.git
cd Tower-Defense
make; make r
